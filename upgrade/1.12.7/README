Upgrade notes:
--------------

- Run the SQL upgrade scripts first. The order should not matter.
- Run the zz_convert_list_params.py upgrade script. Without any extra
  arguments, it will roll back the changes at the end.
- If zz_convert_list_params.py run fine, then run it again with the "--commit"
  option to make the changes permanent.
